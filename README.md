# Doctor-Psychologist
This assignment deals with a drastically simplified version of a famous program called doctor that was
developed at MIT in the early 1960s by Professor Joseph Weizenbaum. The doctor program engages in
a “conversation” with the computer user, in which it mimics a nondirective style of psychotherapy. In the
following sample conversation, the user’s responses are preceded by the prompt symbol **, and the program’s
responses are shown in upper case. In order to simplify the program, we omit most punctuation and represent
the responses of both the user and the machine as Lisp lists.
